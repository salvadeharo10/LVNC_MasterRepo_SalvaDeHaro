# LVNC_MasterRepo_SalvaDeHaro
This repository contains all the materials developed and used by Salvador de Haro during his time as a student, researcher, and doctoral candidate. The context is the development of deep learning models capable of segmenting magnetic resonance imaging slices for the purpose of automated diagnosis of LVNC (low-grade cervical nerve congestion).
