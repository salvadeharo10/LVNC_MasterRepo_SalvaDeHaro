# LVNC_MasterRepo_SalvaDeHaro

## Overview
This repository gathers all materials developed by Salvador de Haro throughout his academic trajectory as a student, researcher, and doctoral candidate. The project focuses on the development, evaluation, and documentation of deep learning methodologies for the automatic segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices, aiming to support computer-assisted diagnosis of **Left Ventricular Non-Compaction (LVNC)**.

The repository is designed to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and structured documentation of experiments, models, and results associated with the research line.

## Objectives
The main goals of this project are:

- Development of robust deep learning architectures for medical image segmentation.
- Implementation of reproducible pipelines for MRI preprocessing and annotation.
- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of model performance.
- Integration of experimental results into scientific documentation and reports prepared in Overleaf/LaTeX environments.
- Facilitation of collaborative research and future extensions of the work.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured pipeline composed of:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**
   - MRI slice normalization.
   - Noise filtering and contrast enhancement.
   - Data augmentation strategies.

2. **Model Development**
   - Implementation of convolutional neural networks tailored for biomedical segmentation.
   - Exploration of encoder-decoder architectures.
   - Hyperparameter optimization.

3. **Training and Validation**
   - Cross-validation and performance benchmarking.
   - Monitoring through loss functions and segmentation metrics.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Dice coefficient.
   - Intersection over Union (IoU).
   - Clinical relevance assessment.

5. **Scientific Documentation**
   - Automated integration of results into LaTeX documents.
   - Reproducible compilation workflows compatible with Overleaf.

## Reproducibility

To ensure reproducibility, all experiments are version-controlled and linked to specific configuration files. The repository provides:

- Fully defined environments.
- Deterministic training options.
- Traceable experiment logging.
